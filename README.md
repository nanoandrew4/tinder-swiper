# tinder-swiper
Script to swipe left on users based on distance and age. You have the option of pausing on profiles matching the criteria you set, which will cause the script to wait for your decision before continuing, or autoliking them, so you can just leave this script to do its work. Created to get around all the new passport users on Tinder without having to deal with it manually :)
