# tinder-swiper
Script to swipe left on users based on distance and age. You have the option of pausing on profiles matching the criteria you set, which will cause the script to wait for your decision before continuing, or autoliking them, so you can just leave this script to do its work. Created to get around all the new passport users on Tinder without having to deal with it manually :)

Just copy paste the whole script into the Console in your browser, which can be found by looking for Developer Options or by pressing F12 (you can also ask Google or your search engine of choice, not hard to find), and let it do its work. I've tested it for a while and it should work fine, but if you find any issues feel free to fork and fix it, or open issues.
